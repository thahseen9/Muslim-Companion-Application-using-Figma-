Problem:
In today's fast-paced world, many Muslims find it
challenging to keep track of their religious obligations
and practices. With various responsibilities and
distractions, maintaining a consistent spiritual
routine can be difficult. Existing apps often lack
comprehensive features, intuitive design, or
culturally sensitive content, leaving users with a
fragmented experience.

Solution:
The Muslim Companion app aims to provide a comprehensive,
all-in-one platform to support Muslims in their daily religious
practices. It includes features like a prayer tracker, Makkah live
stream, Hajj guide, Hajj & Umrah resources, AI-based Islamic
queries (Ask AI Imaan), inspiration page, Halal food finder,
Names of Allah, Islamic calendar, Shahada, Zakat calculator,
mosque finder, types of prayers, Duas, Qibla direction, Tasbih,
Dhikr, Quran access, user profiles, and accurate prayer times.
The app is designed to be user-friendly, intuitive, and culturally
sensitive, ensuring users can seamlessly integrate their faith
into their daily lives.

Mood and Tone:
The app will have a calm, respectful, and uplifting mood and
tone. It will use a color palette that reflects serenity and
spirituality, such as #5CE1E6, #2b338e, #a063c6, #c7fc78, and
#ffa202. The interface will be clean, modern, and easy to
navigate, providing a sense of peace and focus.
